# CSC212-Review-Project 
## Summary

For our first project of the semester in CSC 212, we were tasked with creating a virtual gradebook that can assist us to keep track of our progress 
throughout this course. Our gradebook gives the user the option to create a gradebook for either CSC 212 or another course of their choice. Our submission 
includes the minimum files for the project such as "*main.cpp, gradebook.cpp, and gradebook.h*" and there is an addition to this file configurations by 
adding a couple of classes for Assignments and Categories. By adding these classes, we were able to give the end user more flexibility and editing
capabilities. For our end result, we are able to modify and output all deliverables required by the project criteria.

## Compilation Instructions
To compile our program, the run and debug option within the end users IDE is sufficent to compile and execute the program. The user does not need to insert any command line arguments at the initial run time.

## Runtime Instructions
At run time, the user meets a menu with different gradebook options. These options include...
  1. New Gradebook
  2. Load Gradebook
  3. Import Gradebook
  4. Quit Virtual Gradebook
 Within each choice, the user is then prompted with various options. When the user chooses to create a new Gradebook, they are then prompted
